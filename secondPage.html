                        <p class="text-center center-block">Bike Safety. Even though people bike for leisure and to have fun, they must also consider the consequences of not wearing proper equipment such as a helmet and kneepads. Safety should always be the first step people think of before pushing their foot down on that pedal. If you'd like to know more about bike safety and proper equipment, feel free to join us for our bicycle seminars! They will be held once a month to inform those who are interested in learning and to create a safer environment for everyone.</p>
